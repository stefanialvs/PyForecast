# PYFORECAST

Repository of statistical benchmark models for time series forecasting.

The repository contains the following set of benchmark models:
- Naive
- Seasonal Naive
- Naive2
- Random Walk Drift
- Moving Average
- Seasonal Moving Average
- Croston Method

 The repository contains the following set of evaluation metrics:
- Mean Squared Error
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- Mean Absolute Scaled Error
- Root Mean Squared Scaled Error

An example of use of the code is available in the proof_of_concept.ipynb notebook.

To test the repository tools we use the data available at the [M4 Forecasting Competition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325901666_The_M4_Competition_Results_findings_conclusion_and_way_forward).
